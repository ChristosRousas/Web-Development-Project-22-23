# Web Development Project 22-23

This is the project for the Web Development course of 2022/23.

It is comprised of 2 assignments, Ergasia 1 and Ergasia 2.

Ergasia 1 (Take A Byte) is a static website simply using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without communicating with a web server.

Ergasia 2 (Wiki Shop) is a dynamic website, based on some of the HTML, CSS and JS code of the previous assignment, that communicates with a web server in order to dynamically generate content and perform functions on data.

For more information, see the respective README file of each assignment.
